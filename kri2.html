        About the project
        </h1>
        <h3>
            Our project Advanced Hospital Management System includes
registration of patients, storing their details into the system and also
computerized billing in the pharmacy, and labs. Our software has the facility
to give a unique id for every patient and stores the details of every patient
and the staff automatically. It includes a search facility to know the current
status of each room. User can search availability of a doctor and the details
of a patient using the id.
The Advanced Hospital Management System can be entered
using a username and password. It is accessible either by an administrator or
receptionist. Only they can add data into the database. The data can be
retrieved easily. The interface is very user-friendly. The data are well
protected for personal use and makes the data processing very fast.

            EXISTING SYSTEM
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Existing system refers to the system that is being followed till now.
Presently all the hospital functionalities are done manually. That is if a
patient want to consult a doctor he can visit their till his chance called. This
is make the person very difficult. Out_Patient and In_Patient tickets are
distributed directly. The main disadvantage is time consuming.
        </h3>
        <h2>
            LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING SYSTEM
        </h2>
        <h3>

 Lack of security of data.</br>
 Time consuming.</br>
 Consumes large volume of paper work.</br>
 Manual work.</br>
 No direct role for the higher officials.</br></br>

 To avoid all these limitations and make the system working more
accurately it needs to be computerized.
